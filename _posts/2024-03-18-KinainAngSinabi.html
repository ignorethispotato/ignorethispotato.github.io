<p>Dati may isang studyante na lumapit sa akin at humingi ng payo nung siya ay bumagsak sa kursong hinahawakan ko. At ito ang reply ko sa kanyang email.</p>

<p><i> As mentioned by Dr. XYZ* earlier today in the Frosh convocation, "grades do not define you" and to add to that, a failing grade simply means "not yet".
It does not in any way define you as a person or your character; It just means you're getting there but "not yet". So now, you get another opportunity to learn from another teacher, another set of classmates, and another perspective next term that could help you achieve greater success in your journey. What an exciting thought! I'm excited to see you succeed as any of your ABC* teachers (I can only vouch for your ABC* teachers since I know them personally). You will see what I mean as you get used to life in ABC*.</i></p>

<p>Sa totoo lang, maganda naman ang payo ko sa kanya. Kaso sa kasalukuyang sitwasyon ko, ang bilis sabihin; ang hirap lunukin.</p>
