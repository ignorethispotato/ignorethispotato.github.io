Pagkatapos ng isang araw ng pagmumukmok, ito ang ilan sa mga kasiguraduhang pumasok sa isipan ko:
<ul>
	<li>Letting go and giving-up are not the same. Giving-up is driven by negativity. Letting go is opening yourself up for new opportinunities. So, now I'm opening to shift out of my Math degree and try in another degree, probably back in Computing. The differences are subtle, but makes a lot difference in your frame of thought. For the past few weeks, I've been framing my plan to shift as giving-up and so the conseuqence of that is I keep thinking that I'm a failure and unlearnable that's why I'm shifting out. But the truth is, I am learnable and I'm not lazy. Things just got of hand and overwheling. The way they are handling the courses here for Math is just for me and I don't have the prerequsites. It will take years before I start catching-up. Mathematics was not built overnight.</li>

	<li>The world will not end if I stop studying or fail a course.</li>

	<li>I want to get better</li>
</ul>
